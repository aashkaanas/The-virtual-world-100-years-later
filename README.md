# The-virtual-world-100-years-later
Communicate with other people through thinking...World population use of a common currency...Climate change 
Really you can imagine the world in the next 100 years? Just do it right now. If you ask me, I say so many streets are full of cars that people have taken to the sky and are riding on bird cars. The clothes are a little stranger than usual, to the extent that the strange clothes we see in the show today are considered the simplest of clothes. Trees and plants are even electronic and intelligent, and in some areas even the border between real and unrealistic is not clear; but apart from our imagination and with regard to the speed of science, how will human life be felt in the next 100 years, and how does the ratio Will find it today?
Scientists say the people of the world have escaped from the various monetary and financial units at the outset, all of them resorting to a single currency. In fact, the economic transformation and the transformation of the world into a global village will unify monetary units around the world, and this will be an economic development and prosperity worldwide and for everyone. I think I use the Beat Coevin currency unit...
